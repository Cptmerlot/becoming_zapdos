# Becoming Zapods

> This project was created in order to give ourselves a chance at becoming a zapdos for a github pages project that would look at users repositories and grade them based on their repo count, [Git Pokemon](https://mikeydgithub.github.io/Pokemon-App/), which was a very cool project.
